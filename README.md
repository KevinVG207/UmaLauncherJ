# UmaLauncherJ

Java remake of [Uma Launcher](https://github.com/KevinVG207/UmaLauncher) using the Quarkus framework.

UmaLauncherJ is currently under construction! This readme is a stub and does not include any instructions.
Mainly because the code might still change drastically at any point.

To build, run build.bat or run `.\mvnw clean package "-Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar"`
